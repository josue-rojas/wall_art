# wall_art
Inspired by the wall mirror art and this picture

This project is just for fun and I tried to use canvas as to learn something new but I kinda failed. I felt very limited and confusing the way canvas works. I was about to use a library like p5.js but decided to just use plain css, html, and javascript.

### Install / Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josuerojasrojas/wall_art.git
cd wall_art
npm install
npm run watch
```
and go to your browser localhost:8080

or even easier open download/clone the project and open index.html in your browser.
